# Python Challenge

## PyBank

* In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company, given a set of financial data ([budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv)). The dataset is simple, composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

### Requirements

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script must both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I created a Python script to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 

### Requirements

* Given a set of poll data ([election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv)) composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`, create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, the final script must both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
